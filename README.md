#### i would like a playable "2048" game where you combine smaller numbers to make larger ones in ever-increasing sized squares. if you understand what 2048 is, go ahead and architect it

<think>
Okay, the user wants me to help create a playable 2048 game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They mentioned combining smaller numbers into larger ones on a grid, so I need to outline how to structure this.

First, I'll start by setting up the HTML. The game needs a grid, typically 4x4, so I'll use a div with a grid layout. Each cell will be a div inside this grid container. Also, I should include a score display and a new game button for restarting.

Next, the CSS. Styling is important for the game's appearance. The cells should have different background colors based on their values to make it visually appealing. I'll define classes for each possible number so they can be styled uniquely. The grid itself needs to look like a board with borders and spacing between cells.

Now, the JavaScript part. I need to handle the game logic: initializing the grid, adding new numbers (usually 2 or 4) after each move, moving tiles in different directions, merging them when they collide, and checking for game over conditions.

I'll create a Game2048 class to encapsulate all functionalities. The constructor will set up the grid, add event listeners for key presses, and initialize the game state. The initGrid method will generate the grid elements and append them to the container.

Adding new numbers involves randomly selecting an empty cell and assigning it a value of 2 or 4. I'll need a method to check for empty cells and pick one at random.

Handling moves is crucial. For each direction (left, right, up, down), I'll filter out empty cells, merge adjacent ones with the same value, and update their positions. After moving, I'll add a new number and check if any tiles were moved or merged to determine if another move is possible.

I also need to update the display after each move, which means changing the text content of each cell and applying the appropriate classes for styling based on their values.

Finally, I'll set up event listeners so that arrow keys trigger the move methods. Testing each part incrementally will help catch any bugs early, ensuring smooth gameplay.
